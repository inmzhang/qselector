# QSelector

This simple tool is designed to alleviate the pain of manually typing qubit/coupler names in experimental scripts.

Through a visual interface, users can quickly select desired qubits/couplers and easily copy their list or dictionary with attribute values to the clipboard. This copied content can then be pasted directly into the experimental script.

## Start the application

To start the application, simply pull up a server in the terminal:

```shell
cd qselector
python -m http.server
```
